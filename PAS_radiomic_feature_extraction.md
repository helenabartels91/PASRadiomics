# Workflow for radiomic study for Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) using MR images

This script describes a suggested workflow for extracting radiomic features from MR images of patients with Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS). 

The main workflow of this script is as follows:

1. Defintion of PAS cases and controls
2. Feature extraction using PyRadiomics
3. Loading data
4. Feature normalization 
5. Feature selection 
6. Model training
7. Statistical analysis

# 1. Definition of PAS cases and controls

Cases of PAS are included when the following criteria are met:
- antenatal imaging: participants who underwent MRI for suspicion of PAS based on the presence of standardised ultrasound features (1)
- intraoperative findings: at the time of laparotomy, clinical features of PAS as defined by the FIGO classification are present (2) 
- histopathology: examination of hysterectomy specimen or myometrial resection with placental tissue with evidence of adherent or invasive placentation as described (3). 

Controls:
Participants with placenta previa and at least one prior caesarean section, who had no ultrasound or MRI features of PAS, and spontaneous placental separation at the time of laparotomy. Placenta previa was defined as the placenta completely covering the internal os on transvaginal ultrasound beyond 20 weeksâ€™ gestation (4). 

In this example, 41 cases and 6 controls were included. Radiomic feature extraction was performed using Pyradiomics (5), resulting in a total of 1820 radiomic features being extracted from 7 feature families, both from the original image and using convolutional image filters such as Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelets.

# 2. Feature extraction using PyRadiomics 

Segmentations were created using Osirix. Two placental ROIs were generated, based on proximity to the area of adherence or invasive (inferior placental ROI) and remote from this area (superior placental ROI)

Segmentations were exported from Osirix as JSON files using the "Export ROIs" plugin. 

In 3D slicer, nrrd. files for the MRI image and the segmentations were created. A csv. file with column headings "study ID", "image" and "mask" was created. 

Radiomic features were then extracted using pyradiomics using the following script.
